# Fake-News-Detection

In the digital age where fake news proliferates rapidly, our project explores the use of advanced NLP techniques for effective detection and differentiation of true vs. false narratives. With the rise of social media and the widespread dissemination of information, the spread of fake news has become a significant issue in society. Fake news often has characteristics such as sensational headlines, emotionally charged language, lack of credible sources, and confirmation bias. Our project aims to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of both models in fake news detection, providing insights into their performance and potential applications in automated fact-checking. We harness the strengths of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Transformer models, renowned for their ability to process sequential data and large datasets, respectively, in the context of complex text analysis. We were able to get around 62\% accuracy for our models.
